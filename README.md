# HSC
main.m in 2dtest provides the parameter inference program in a simulated two-gene system by gradient descent algorithm.  
landscape.m in landscape provides the program of construction of the landscape for HSC model (Chenyong Zhang and Chunhe Li*, Revealing the mechanism of lymphoid and myeloid cell differentiation and transdifferentiation through landscape quantification. Physical Review Research 3: 013186 (2021)).  
The above program was implemented on MATLABR2018a and MATLABR2020b
